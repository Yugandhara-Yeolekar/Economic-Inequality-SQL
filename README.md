# Economic Inequality: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | SQL

## Objective

This project focuses on analyzing global economic inequality using SQL. The dataset includes metrics such as wealth distribution, income inequality (pre-tax and post-tax), and income or consumption levels across different economic groups. The goal is to clean the data, explore key insights, and highlight patterns in wealth concentration and income distribution worldwide.

## Methodology

The analysis was performed using SQL, focusing on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The key steps included:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring consistency in the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Using SQL queries to extract insights into wealth distribution, income inequality, and the impact of taxation on income distribution.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Identifying differences in economic inequality across countries by analyzing key indicators such as the Gini coefficient and income shares of different economic groups.

The results of this analysis have been visualized in an interactive **Tableau dashboard**. You can explore the visual representation of this data here:

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights the stark disparities in global wealth and income distribution. Some nations, particularly those with high wealth concentration in the top 1%, face extreme economic inequality. The role of taxation and government policies significantly impacts income distribution, with some countries using progressive taxation to reduce inequality, while others show minimal redistribution.

Further research and policy interventions are crucial to addressing these imbalances, ensuring fairer economic opportunities, and promoting sustainable growth.
